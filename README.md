# 🌿 Wellness DAO: Community-Led Wellness Programs

Welcome to Wellness DAO, a decentralized autonomous organization built on the Stacks blockchain that empowers communities to collaboratively design, vote on, and fund wellness initiatives! This project addresses the real-world problem of centralized health programs that often lack community input, transparency, and accessibility—leading to low participation and ineffective outcomes. By leveraging blockchain, we enable transparent voting, fair funding allocation, and incentivized participation in wellness activities like fitness challenges, mental health workshops, nutrition education, and community events.

## ✨ Features

🗳️ Create and vote on wellness initiatives  
💰 Community treasury for funding approved programs  
👥 Membership via staking governance tokens  
🏆 Rewards for participation in initiatives  
📊 Track progress and outcomes transparently  
🔒 Immutable records of votes and fund distributions  
🚀 Scalable for local or global communities  
✅ Prevent sybil attacks with token-weighted voting  

## 🛠 How It Works

**For Community Members**  
- Join the DAO by staking Wellness Tokens (our governance token) via the membership contract.  
- Propose a new wellness initiative (e.g., "Weekly Yoga Sessions") with details like description, budget, and timeline.  
- Vote on active proposals using your staked tokens—votes are weighted by stake amount.  
- Participate in approved initiatives and earn rewards for completing milestones (e.g., attending sessions).  

**For Initiative Organizers**  
- Submit proposals through the proposal contract.  
- Once approved, access treasury funds to execute the program.  
- Use the execution contract to track participant engagement and distribute rewards.  

**For Verifiers/Auditors**  
- Query the DAO contract to view proposal details, vote tallies, and fund flows.  
- Verify participation rewards via the rewards contract for transparency.  

That's it! Empower your community to lead healthier lives through decentralized governance.
